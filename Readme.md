# What

(2024-02, 2024-05, 2024-09, 2024-10)

Arduino library with base type definitions.

Naming of base types and function signatures. Root module.


## Code

* [Interface][Interface]


## Requirements

  * arduino-cli
  * bash


## Install/remove

That's a root library. So there are no dependencies.
Still I would advise to clone [GetLibs][GetLibs] repo
and run it's code to get all my stuff.
